        <h4><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/explore"target="_blank" style=color:darkblue><b>TikTok:</b></a></h4>
        <p>TikTok is a global short-form video platform launched in 2016 by ByteDance, originally as Douyin in China before expanding internationally. The app allows users to create and share 15- to 60-second videos, with features like filters, effects, music, and tools for duets and reactions. Its powerful algorithm personalizes the "For You Page" (FYP), making content highly addictive and capable of turning trends, songs, and creators into overnight sensations. With over 1 billion monthly users, TikTok is especially popular among Gen Z and Millennials, driving viral dance challenges, memes, and even educational content. However, it has faced scrutiny over data privacy concerns, leading to bans in some countries like India and restrictions in the U.S. Despite controversies, TikTok remains a dominant force in social media, competing with Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts while offering monetization through its Creator Fund, live gifts, and e-commerce integrations like TikTok Shop.</p>

    <h4><a href="https://www.youtube.com/"target="_blank" style="color: red"><b>Youtube:</b></a></h4>
    <p>YouTube is a video-sharing platform launched in 2005 and later acquired by Google in 2006. It allows users to upload, view, and share videos ranging from short clips to full-length movies and live streams. With over <b>2.7 billion monthly logged-in users</b>, YouTube dominates online video content, offering features like monetization (ads, memberships, Super Chats), YouTube Shorts (for TikTok-style clips), and YouTube Premium for ad-free viewing. The platform is popular for entertainment, education, music, and influencer culture, though it faces challenges like copyright disputes, misinformation, and advertiser controversies. Competitors include TikTok (for short-form video) and Vimeo (for professional content), but YouTube remains the largest video platform globally.</p>

<a href="https://www.snapchat.com/"target="_blank" style=color:darkorange><b>Snapchat:</b></a> Send disappearing messages and short videos</p>
<p>Snapchat is a multimedia messaging app launched in 2011, known for pioneering disappearing messages and ephemeral content. Focused on private, visual communication, it allows users to send photos, videos (called "Snaps"), and text chats that vanish after viewing, along with public "Stories" that last 24 hours. The app popularized augmented reality (AR) filters (Lenses), Discover (for publisher content), and Snap Map (location sharing). With **over 750 million monthly active users**, Snapchat is especially popular among Gen Z and Millennials for casual, creative sharing. Its key features include Spotlight (for short viral videos, competing with TikTok), Memories (saved Snaps), and monetization through ads and premium subscriptions (Snapchat+). Despite competition from Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat remains a leader in private messaging and AR innovation.</p>

<p>Instagram is a photo and video-sharing social media platform launched in 2010 and acquired by Facebook (now Meta) in 2012. Initially designed for square-format photos with artistic filters, it has evolved into a multifaceted app featuring **Stories** (24-hour disappearing posts), **Reels** (short-form videos to rival TikTok), **IGTV** (longer videos), and **Live** streaming. With **over 2 billion monthly active users**, Instagram is a hub for influencers, brands, and creators, offering monetization through ads, sponsorships, and the **Instagram Partner Program**. The platform emphasizes visual storytelling with features like **DMs** (private messaging), **Explore** (content discovery), and **Shopping** (e-commerce integration). Despite competition from TikTok and Snapchat, Instagram remains a dominant force in social media, blending creativity, community, and commerce.</p>

<A href="https://www.facebook.com/"target="_blank" style=color:blue><b>Facebook</b></A>
<p>Facebook is a social media and networking platform launched in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and his Harvard University roommates. Initially designed as a college networking site, it quickly expanded globally, becoming the worldâ€™s largest social network with <b>over 3 billion monthly active users</b> (including its family of apps like Instagram and WhatsApp). Facebook allows users to share posts, photos, videos, and links, interact through reactions and comments, join groups, follow pages, and use Marketplace for buying/selling goods. Key features include News Feed (personalized content), Facebook Live (real-time streaming), Events, and Meta Business Suite (for advertisers). Despite its dominance, Facebook faces criticism over data privacy (e.g., Cambridge Analytica scandal), misinformation, and algorithmic bias. Now under <b>Meta Platforms Inc.</b>, it focuses on the metaverse (VR/AR integration) while competing with TikTok, YouTube, and emerging platforms.</p>
